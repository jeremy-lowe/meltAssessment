head
- what is needed up here?
- look at boiler plates and melt's sites
- use an icon?	

-----
other
- watch special characters
- once you remove these comments watch your indenting and such
- also don't forget to clean up comments in scss files
- how much can you play with the way codekit exports/formats stuff?
	(a little..... don't like that it expands the reset)
- maybe watch your font sizes.... don't eyeball so much as get them off the psd file
	
- git
	- this seems to have been fixed.... not sure what/how...
		a? project files need to sit in the directory defined in preferences > general
		b? set up the project on github first (with readme.md), 
			- clone it into getkracken (under file menu or use that "very obvious" folder icon)
			- add files into the folder that gets created on your hard drive

	hero
	- tricky part here is the bg image
		- how will it "cover" on small screens when content gets real long
		- also at larger sizes its underneath the header menu
		(probably giving the header an absolute position will take care of that)
	- order of text/image?
	- will need to wrap text in something like .heroText
	(should the image get wrapped in something?)
	- flexbox/float?
	- also treatment of the "buttons" i'll have to watch.... use a mixin...
	(simplest styling solution would to just use an <a> on the form)

	get in touch
	- this'll be troublesome
	- the map
		- i guess, yeah, just do it as an image instead of an embed
		- though link it to the google map?
		- also watch how it stretches full width
			- its not a background
			- so it'll need to sit outside the .sectInner
		- then play with the positioning of "get in touch"
			- below on mobile
			- over the top on larger screens
			- woould flexbox be necessary for this?
		- social media icons
			- need to set up the markup for that
			- anything special for hovers?  (if they are bg's you can't change color)

	contact
	- so forms are never any fun
	- might wanna pull the placeholder text above (you know usability, damn it)
	- then think about alternate place holder text?
	- might wanna think about the visual separation of this from the above....
	- might need the from as a list to help control sizes and placement and such
	- also.... treatment of the button
		- will the same css (a mixin/variable) work on a submit button as it will on a link?
